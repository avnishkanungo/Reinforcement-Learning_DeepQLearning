# Deep Q-Learning on Cartpole Gym Environment

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to apply Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to solve the Cartpole problem using the OpenAI Gym environment. The Cartpole problem is a classic control problem in reinforcement learning, where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart by moving the cart left or right.

## Cartpole Gym Environment

The Cartpole environment provided by OpenAI Gym consists of a cart attached to a pole, which is hinged on one end. The goal is to keep the pole balanced upright by applying left or right force to the cart. The state space consists of four continuous variables: the cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity. The action space consists of two discrete actions: moving left or right.

## Deep Q-Learning Algorithm

Deep Q-Learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn the optimal action-value function Q*(s, a), which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action a in state s. The algorithm utilizes a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize Replay Memory**: Initialize a replay memory buffer to store past experiences (s, a, r, s').

2. **Initialize Q-Network**: Initialize a deep neural network with weights θ to approximate the action-value function Q(s, a; θ).

3. **Loop Over Episodes**:

    a. Reset environment to initial state s_0.
    
    b. **Loop Over Time Steps**:
    
        i. Select action a_t using an epsilon-greedy policy based on Q(s, a; θ).
        
        ii. Execute action a_t and observe reward r_t and next state s_{t+1}.
        
        iii. Store transition (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}) in replay memory.
        
        iv. Sample a mini-batch of experiences from replay memory.
        
        v. Compute target y_i = r_i + γ max_{a'} Q(s_{i+1}, a'; θ^-), where γ is the discount factor.
        
        vi. Update the Q-network by minimizing the loss L = (1/N) * sum_i (y_i - Q(s_i, a_i; θ))^2.
        
        vii. Every C steps, update the target network weights: θ^- <- θ.
        
        viii. Repeat steps (i) - (vii) for a fixed number of episodes or until convergence.
